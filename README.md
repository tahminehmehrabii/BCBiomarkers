# Reproducing the results

To reproduce the results, the following R scripts were executed:

mergeDatasets.R: Merged the microarray datasets based on their common genes.

trainValidSplit.R: Split the merged datasets into training and validation datasets.

batchCorrection.R: Corrected batch effects in both the training and validation datasets.

differentialExpressionAnalysis.R: Identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the training dataset.

enrichmentAnalysis.R: Provided insights into the biological significance of the DEGs.

geneCoexpressionAnalysis.R: Constructed co-expression modules in the training dataset using the CEMiTool package with default settings.

overlappedGenes.R: Identified genes that overlapped between the DEGs and the most significant module found by CEMiTool.

centralityAnalysis.R: Identified key genes in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network.

LASSO.R: Selected candidate diagnostic genes from the key genes in the training dataset.

ROC.R: Evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the candidate diagnostic genes in both the training and validation datasets.

trainEvaluateML.R: Verified the accuracy of diagnostic genes in distinguishing between normal and tumor samples using machine learning models.

SignallingAnalysis.R: Assessed signaling pathways in breast cancer (BC) and analyzed the correlation between biomarkers and these pathways.
