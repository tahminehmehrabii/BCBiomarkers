# Reproducing the results

To reproduce the results, the following R scripts were executed:

## 1. mergeDatasets.R:
Merged the microarray datasets based on their common genes.

## 2. trainValidSplit.R: 
Split the merged datasets into training and validation datasets.

## 3. batchCorrection.R: 
Corrected batch effects in both the training and validation datasets.

## 4. differentialExpressionAnalysis.R: 
Identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the training dataset.

## 5. enrichmentAnalysis.R: 
Provided insights into the biological significance of the DEGs.

## 6. geneCoexpressionAnalysis.R: 
Constructed co-expression modules in the training dataset using the CEMiTool package with default settings.

## 7. overlappedGenes.R: 
Identified genes that overlapped between the DEGs and the most significant module found by CEMiTool.

## 8. centralityAnalysis.R: 
Identified key genes in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network.

## 9. LASSO.R: 
Selected candidate diagnostic genes from the key genes in the training dataset.

## 10. ROC.R: 
Evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the candidate diagnostic genes in both the training and validation datasets.

## 11. trainEvaluateML.R: 
Verified the accuracy of diagnostic genes in distinguishing between normal and tumor samples using machine learning models.

## 12. SignallingAnalysis.R: 
Assessed signaling pathways in breast cancer (BC) and analyzed the correlation between biomarkers and these pathways.
